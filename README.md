#mapbox

Script made to automate the generation of maps from overpass api using Openstreetmaps data with terrain.party coordinates.

It just needs the README file that comes in terrain.party height maps zip file.

Run the code on Linux:

Python3 "name of README file"

Run the code on Windows Command Prompt:
1. Open the command prompt windows by pressing the Win+R key combination, which will take you to the Run dialog. Once youâ€™re there, type in cmd and press Enter.

2. In the cmd window type:
    python "name of README file"

Use exact name of the file and the code will read it and download the .osm map file from overpass api for use in OpenStreetMap Import mod for Cities Skylines.

For windows users still with doubt on how to run the code i found this video on youtube explaining how to run a python code on windows:
